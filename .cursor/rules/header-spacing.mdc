# Header Spacing Rule

## Description

This rule ensures consistent and readable markdown document formatting by requiring an empty line between headers and their content. This improves readability and makes the document structure clearer.

## Rule

When writing markdown documents:

1. There **MUST** be an empty line between any header (any level `#`, `##`, ..., `######`) and its following content
2. This applies to all types of content following a header (text, lists, code blocks, etc.)
3. This rule applies to all markdown files in the repository

## Implementation

- When writing markdown content:
  - After writing a header, add a blank line before starting the content
  - Ensure existing headers are followed by a blank line
  - During code reviews, check for proper spacing between headers and content

## Benefits

- Improved readability and document structure
- Consistent formatting across all documentation
- Better rendering in markdown viewers
- Easier visual parsing of document structure

## Examples

✔️ Correct:

```markdown
## Header

This is the content that follows the header with a blank line in between.

### Another Header

- List item 1
- List item 2
```

❌ Incorrect:

```markdown
## Header
This is content without a blank line after the header.

### Another Header
- No blank line before this list
```
